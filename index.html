            <h1>Hi, I'm Nina.</h1>
            <p>I'm a second-generation Vietnamese-Chinese Canadian, born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. My parents' lived experiences and my identity as an Asian Canadian form the core of my worldview and were the main drivers behind why I first decided to pursue a B.A. (Adv.) in Global Political Economy at the <a href="https://news.umanitoba.ca/convocation-2020-beyond-the-classroom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Manitoba</a>.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated with a Master in Development Studies from the Geneva Graduate Institute, where I specialized in migration and human rights. During my program, I co-authored a <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/qatar-report-alleges-g4s-qatar-migrant-workers-continue-to-pay-illegal-recruitment-fees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report on unfair recruitment and debt bondage</a> experienced by migrant workers in Qatar.</p>
            <p>One of my biggest passions is the intersection between youth empowerment and governance. In 2022, I led the <a href="https://youngdiplomats.ca/2022-highlevel-political-forum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young Diplomats of Canada</a>'s delegation to the UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. I was also involved in the Youth Parliament of Manitoba for seven years, during which I served in all five positions on the board of directors and represented Manitoba at youth parliaments both nationally and internationally.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work for the Government of Manitoba as an immigration program officer. My lifelong ambition is to dedicate my time toward efforts that make the world a more equitable place. If you share that pursuit, let's connect!</p>
